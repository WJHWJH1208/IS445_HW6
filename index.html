        <h2>relationship between cloud cover and average temperature across seasons.</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Description:</strong> This scatter plot shows the relationship between cloud cover and average temperature across seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Encoding: The x-axis is cloud cover (0-100%), and the y-axis is average temperature (Â°F).
            Color Scheme: Seasons are color-coded to differentiate patterns, with semi-transparent circles to reduce overlap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data was filtered for valid cloud cover and temperature values, with cloud cover normalized to 0-1.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Comparison with previous Homework #5:</strong> "In Homework #5, color was used for seasons but lacked interactivity and data cleaning." For this homework, I added interactivity, tooltips, and data filtering.

        <h2>relationship between Latitude and Wind Speed Distribution Across Seasons</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Description:</strong> This scatter plot shows the relationship between latitude and wind speed across seasons. Latitude is on the x-axis (limited to 25-50 degrees), and wind speed is on the y-axis. Each season has a distinct color, and semi-transparent circles reduce overlap, enhancing readability. Tooltips offer additional details.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dataset was filtered to include valid dates and known seasons only, ensuring data accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Comparison with previous Homework #5:</strong>  Compared to HW5, this version adds seasonal color coding, constrained latitude range, and improved point opacity, making seasonal patterns clearer and the chart more readable.
